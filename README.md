# Distributed-Systems-Project

A modular microservice-based system built with Python, gRPC, and REST. It supports user registration, authentication with JWT, real-time messaging, and file upload/download. The system demonstrates distributed system principles including stateless communication, interoperability, and fault isolation using Docker containers and MongoDB as a shared data store.
